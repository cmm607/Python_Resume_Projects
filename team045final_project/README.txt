# Mileage Run Finder

## Description

The **The Mileage Run Finder** is a Python application, an interactive tool tailored for frequent flyers who want to achieve their airline's frequent flyer status efficiently. By leveraging multi-objective optimization (MOO), the tool allows users to find and rank flight routes that align with their specific goals, such as maximizing miles, minimizing travel time, or limiting connections. Users can adjust weights and preferences to rerank routes interactively.
The tool bridges the gap in existing flight search platforms by addressing the specific needs of frequent flyers, empowering them to achieve their status goals while balancing time, cost, and convenience.

Key Features:
- Tailored for frequent flyers seeking to optimize routes for airline status goals.
- Incorporates multi-objective optimization for ranking routes based on user-defined priorities.
- Interactive and intuitive, enabling users to explore and analyze flight options comprehensively.
